## Quick notes
The events nav link will bring you to an events page. All other nav links will return to index.

The images are low quality due to being cut from the sample doc.

Fonts are not an exact match but I attempted to match font weight and size. 

The components are underbuilt. For example, the CardEvent component could accept a date property
which is then used to get the specific day and month as opposed to needing these hard coded. Also,
these components should reasonably have an id to link them to an external page.
